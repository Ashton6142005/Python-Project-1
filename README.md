'''Write a program to calculate the cost to paint a wall. Amount of required paint is based on the wall area. Total cost includes paint and sales tax.

Note: This program is designed for incremental development. Complete each step and print before starting the next step. 

Step 1. Read from input wall height, wall width, and cost of one paint can (doubles). Calculate and output the wall's area to one decimal place using format specifiers.



Ex: If the input is:
12.0 15.0 29.95
the output is:
Wall area: 180.0 sq ft


Step 2. Calculate and output the amount of paint needed to three decimal places. One gallon of paint covers 350 square feet.
Ex: If the input is:
12.0 15.0 29.95
the output is:
Wall area: 180.0 sq ft
Paint needed: 0.514 gallons.


Step 3. Calculate and output the number of 1-gallon cans needed to paint the wall. Extra paint may be left over. Hint: Use math.ceil() to round up to the nearest gallon and convert to an integer. 
Ex: If the input is:
12.0 15.0 29.95
the output is:
Wall area: 180.0 sq ft
Paint needed: 0.514 gallons.
Cans needed: 1 can(s)


Step 4. Calculate and output the paint cost, sales tax of 7%, and total cost. Dollar values are output with two decimal places. 
Ex: If the input is:
8.0 8.0 49.20
the output is:
Wall area: 64.0 sq ft
Paint needed: 0.183 gallons.
Cans needed: 1 can(s)
Paint cost: $49.20
Sales tax: $3.44
Total cost: $52.64
